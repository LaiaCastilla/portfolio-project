              A junior front-end developer based in Swizerland
            </h2>
            <p>
              Originally from Barcelona, I have always been an unusually
              imaginative and curious person. Being the latter the reason why I
              moved to Switzerland to pursue a PhD in Chemistry. It was then
              when I started to explore the digital media as means of creation,
              being always extremely enthusiastic whenever I had to use Adobe
              Illustrator to create images that could visually explain in an
              intuitive way the scientific advances we were doing.
              <br /><br />
              During a needed break following my studies, I realised how much I
              had craved creativity during the last few years. I then discovered
              the art of crafting aesthetically pleasing and accessible
              webpages, visual essays and storytelling. I was amazed by the work
              of numerous front-end developers and webdesigners.
              <em>I would love to do that!</em> I told myself.
              <em>What is stoping you?</em> I answered. Not knowing how to do it
              being the only reasonable answer I could give, I decided to take a
              leap and do with my life whatever makes me happy. <br /><br />
              I am now forming myself as a front-end developer, feeling at ease
              with the coding logics and the idea of constantly changing
              languages! I am looking forward to growing as a developer,
              learning from my peers and slowly but surely becoming able of
              creating webpages as inspiring as the ones that got me here!
